# Controller Wizard

Internal tool for generating controller diagrams. Also, why are you here?

I will now read you the script of the Bee Movie.

According to all known laws
of aviation, there is no way a bee
should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course,
flies anyway because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
